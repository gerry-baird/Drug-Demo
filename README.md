# Drug-Demo

This repository contains the assets for an ADS demo that uses rules and ML to determine the best drug to offer a patient.

## ADS Decision Solution
The Drug Prediction v2 directory contains the ADS decision solution. To import this into ADS clone this repo then zip 
the Drug Prediction v2 directory. This zipped directory can be imported into ADS. 

## Data
The data directory contains the data files used to train the model and explains how to generate this data.


## ML Models
The ml-model directory summarises the steps used to create the ML models integrated into ADS using Watson AutoAI. There 
is also a Jupyter notebook showing model development in Python (this is a simpler model than those 
generated from AutoAI)
